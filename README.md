# Brexit at Tiffany's

[Make Brexit as delicious as breakfast](https://twitter.com/elliwsan/status/783246302691876868). This Chrome extension replaces all occurrences of the word Brexit with the word breakfast. Enjoy!

(If you've already installed this extension, this readme may be a bit confusing. Well, not as confusing as Brexit itself, I suppose.)

## Installation
* Download https://github.com/nieske/brexit-at-tiffanys/archive/master.zip.
* Unzip it and put the resulting folder somewhere on your computer.
* Go to Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` in your address bar.
* Tick the check box in the upper right corner that says "Developer mode", which will make a new line with buttons appear.
* From those new buttons, click the "Load unpacked extension..." button, browse to your Brexit at Tiffany's folder and click "Select".

Now, you're all set! Go browse http://www.bbc.com/news/politics or something. Have fun. Hope it doesn't make you too hungry.

This extension is based on [this excellent tutorial](https://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions). The initial version is by [Lady Geek](http://ladygeek.nl). Please feel free to make your own adaptations.
